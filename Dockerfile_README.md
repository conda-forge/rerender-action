## Getting Started & Usage

To use this action, add the following YAML file at `.github/workflows/webservices.yml`

```yaml
on: repository_dispatch

jobs:
  webservices:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: webservices
    steps:
      - name: webservices
        id: webservices
        uses: conda-forge/webservices-dispatch-action@main
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          rerendering_github_token: ${{ secrets.RERENDERING_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Then issue a repository dispatch event in the GitHub API with the correct JSON blob.

For example, a rerender uses:

```json
{"event_type": "rerender", "client_payload": {"pr": 12}}
```

The form of the JSON blobs for various actions can be found in 
the [package entrypoint](https://github.com/conda-forge/webservices-dispatch-action/blob/main/webservices_dispatch_action/__main__.py).
